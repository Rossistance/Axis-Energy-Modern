# Design Concept: Canopy Living System

## Inspiration & Research
- Biophilic principles from [Shopify Sustainability Report 2024](https://www.shopify.com/sustainability) and [Patagonia](https://www.patagonia.com) immersive storytelling.
- Interaction cues from [IDEO 2024 redesign](https://www.ideo.com/) featuring soft organic curves and audio-backed narratives.

## Page Inventory (8 pages)
Includes Home, Services, Projects, Why Axis, About, News, Careers, Contact. Original textual content is surfaced in organic panels and soundscapes described below.

## Global Experience
- **Organic Navigation Ribbon:** Curved nav bar flowing across top with subtle sway animation tied to scroll velocity.
- **Ambient Soundscapes:** Optional toggle to hear wind/solar ambience aligning with section theme.
- **Story Pods:** Each section uses softly rounded pods connected by vine-like dividers referencing sustainability.

## Color Palette
| Role | Hex | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Canopy Cream | `#FAF6EE` | Warm background |
| Forest Ink | `#1D2A24` | Primary text |
| Moss Glow | `#88B04B` | Primary accent |
| Riverstone | `#5B6D70` | Secondary accent |
| Sky Veil | `#BFD4E6` | Ambient gradients |

Typography: **Canela** for headlines, **Soehne** for body copy.

## Hero & Imagery
- **Home Hero:** Slow-motion footage of morning light through solar arrays; hero card floats with organic mask and includes existing headline/lead/CTAs.
- **Services:** Hand-drawn illustrations showing EPC and O&M ecosystems; icons animate gently.
- **Projects:** Collage of photography layered with botanical overlays referencing each project location.
- **Team/About:** Portraits surrounded by leaf silhouettes that respond to hover.

## Interaction Highlights
- Sections transition with liquid reveal effect; background gradient shifts from dawn to dusk as user scrolls.
- Scroll-triggered storytelling: as each sentence from existing copy appears, a small pulse travels along the vine connector.
- Contact page uses interactive map with watercolor style.

## Page-by-Page Structure & Content Mapping
### Home
1. **Canopy Hero:** Contains eyebrow, headline, lead, and CTAs exactly as written; hero card drifts subtly.
2. **Roots of Trust:** "One solid, reliable partner" copy displayed inside overlapping organic pods with supporting iconography.
3. **Service Ecosystem:** EPC and O&M blurbs appear in pillowy cards with illustrated backgrounds.
4. **Community Invitation:** "Let’s build what’s next" messaging anchored in Moss Glow CTA ribbon.

### Services
- Existing service paragraphs reorganized into three organic panels: "Groundwork", "Growth", "Care" with supportive stats.

### Projects
- Project copy appears in stacked story pods with location tags and watercolor backdrops.

### Why Axis
- Value statements arranged in looping path; as each block enters view, the vine highlight animates to emphasize text.

### About
- Company narrative forms part of an illustrated timeline reminiscent of tree rings; original copy inserted into each ring.

### News
- Articles presented as tactile cards with torn-paper edges; copy remains intact.

### Careers
- Job descriptions live in expanding pods with background textures; culture statements rendered as handwritten quotes.

### Contact
- Contact details and form placed on translucent leaf card; existing address/phone/email preserved within info badges.

## Accessibility & Performance
- Warm background with Forest Ink text meets 4.5:1 contrast; CTA buttons use darker Moss overlays when focused.
- Provide "Simplify motion" toggle to remove liquid transitions and disable audio.
- Use SVG filters sparingly to maintain performance; fallback static gradients for older browsers.
