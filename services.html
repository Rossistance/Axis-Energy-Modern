          <h2>Axis Operations &amp; Maintenance – Consolidated Business Plan</h2>
          <p>Axis Energy is currently well positioned in the Southeast to develop Operations and Maintenance capabilities that will grow as assets built within the last 5 years begin to show wear and tear.</p>
          <p>The solar industry in the Southeast is still relatively immature, with the majority of utility scale solar assets currently operating within the first 5-10 years on average of a 25 year production lifecycle.</p>
          <p>As EPC and equipment manufacturer warranties start to expire after 5-10 years typically the need for dedicated O&amp;M providers will only increase.</p>

          <h3>Business case</h3>
          <p>O&amp;M contracts range from 1-5 years and are awarded through a competitive bid process. Maintenance activities typically include Landscaping, routine inspection, module washing and performance monitoring. Troubleshooting system problems are typically subject to pre-negotiated Time and material rates and are handled apart from the base contract maintenance activities. Technical expertise and the ability to respond within 24-48hrs are critical to long term success. Assets that are down in production are losing revenue by the hour!</p>
          <p>Preventive maintenance accounts for approximately 45% of the annual O&amp;M costs while Corrective maintenance accounts for the remaining 55%. Monitoring costs are minimal as they are usually sold as a service package with the purchase of any particular SCADA/DAS platform. As with any asset that operates daily, maintenance costs will undoubtedly increase over time as will the need for skilled maintenance technicians that can recognize/correct issues quickly and minimize downtime.</p>
